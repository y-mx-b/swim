# Swim

A simple window management library written in C. Check the
[documentation](https://y-mx-b.github.io/swim/) for more information.

## Goals

- Simple, consistent, barebones API
- Easy to understand and use
- Documentation

## Documentation

You can browse the documentation online at https://y-mx-b.github.io/swim/ or
you can browse it locally.

Documentation is generated with doxygen.

```sh
doxygen
```

To browse the documentation locally, open the file `docs/index.html` in your
preferred browser.

## TODO

- [x] Write documentation (Doxygen comments + proper documentation)
- [X] Implement window movement and resizing
- [ ] Implement grid-based resizing (maybe?)
- [ ] Implement modal drawing support
- [ ] Improve memory usage, make application objects global
  - [ ] Use a table to store open applications?
