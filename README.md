# Swim

A simple window management library written in C. Check the
[documentation](https://github.com/y-mx-b/swim/tree/master/docs) for more information.

## Goals

- Simple, consistent, barebones API
- Easy to understand and use

## Documentation

Documentation is to be generated with `doxygen`.

```sh
doxygen
```

## TODO

- [X] Write documentation (Doxygen comments + proper documentation)
- [ ] Implement window movement and resizing
- [ ] Implement grid resizing (maybe?)
- [ ] Implement modal drawing support
