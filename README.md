# swim

A simple window management library written in C. Check the
[documentation](https://github.com/y-mx-b/swim/tree/master/docs) for more information.

## Goals:
- Simple, consistent, barebones API
- Easy to understand and use

## TODO:
- Implement window movement and resizing
- Implement grid resizing (maybe?)
- Implement modal drawing support
- Write documentation (Doxygen comments + proper documentation)
