# Swim

A simple window management library written in C. Check the
[documentation](#documentation) for more information.

## Goals

- Simple, consistent, barebones API
- Easy to understand and use

## Documentation

You can browse the documentation online at https://y-mx-b.github.io/swim/ or
you can browse it locally.

Documentation is generated with `doxygen`.

```sh
doxygen
```

To browse the documentation locally, open the file `html/index.html` in your
preferred browser.

## TODO

- [X] Write documentation (Doxygen comments + proper documentation)
- [ ] Implement window movement and resizing
- [ ] Implement grid-based resizing (maybe?)
- [ ] Implement modal drawing support
